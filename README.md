### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I wanted to complete this project strictly using the Bootstrap Framework. I got more comfortable with the Bootstrap grid system and how it compares to using regular CSS flexbox.

### Continued development

I will incorporate Javascript to this project to make filling out the form necessary and saving the input values.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) - Read and used the Bootstrap documentation.
- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Used this resource for manipulating the bootstrap columns/sizes.
